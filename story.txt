A guy named Joe was on a road trip to visit some friends who lived across the country. It was getting late, and he was still hours away, so he decided to check into a nearby motel. When he walked up to the front desk and asked for a room, the employee at the desk told him he should find somewhere else to stay, as the only room they had available was supposedly haunted by the ghost of a man who had died there. 
After driving for nearly 9 hours with just two 20 minute breaks in between, Joe was very exhausted. As an ex Marine, he really wasn't afraid of ghosts. He told the receptionsit ,"Once marine always a marine. I ain't got scared of nothing". He made himself a coffee and went upstairs. When he got to his room however, things felt a little weird. The room was too clean. Way too clean. Although this motel was very old, this room felt like it was built pretty recently. 
Joe was terrified on the inside, but refused to admit it to a single soul to keep his strong Marine reputation alive. He kept asking himself, "Why was i put in this exact room? Is this a sick joke?" Joe was so tired that he wiped out on the bed, but was woken up by a cool breeze. 
The cool breeze was especially eerie due to the fact that the hotel did not have air conditioning and he was in the middle of a very hot area. Joe brushed it aside and went back to sleep, but was awoken again by laughing, which came from the bathroom. 
This time, Joe was fed up. Joe took his pocketknife and approached the bathroom to see blood dripping all over the once perfectly mirrors. He felt a prescence of something hiding behind the shower curtain. Instead of opening the shower curtain to face whoever was inside the bathtub, Joe took his things and ran out of the room, into his car, and straight to his friends house. 
Thankfully, Joe made it out alive. However, if he stayed for longer, who knows what could have happened!
