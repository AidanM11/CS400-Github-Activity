A guy named Joe was on a road trip to visit some friends who lived across the country. It was getting late, and he was still hours away, so he decided to check into a nearby motel. When he walked up to the front desk and asked for a room, the employee at the desk told him he should find somewhere else to stay, as the only room they had available was supposedly haunted by the ghost of a man who had died there. 
After driving for nearly 9 hours with just two 20 minute breaks in between, Joe was very exhausted. As an ex Marine, he really wasn't afraid of ghosts. He told the receptionsit ,"Once marine always a marine. I ain't got scared of nothing". He made himself a coffee and went upstairs. When he got to his room however, things felt a little weird. The room was too clean. Way too clean. Although this motel was very old, this room felt like it was built pretty recently.
