A guy named Joe was on a road trip to visit some friends who lived across the country. It was getting late, and he was still hours away, so he decided to check into a nearby motel. When he walked up to the front desk and asked for a room, the employee at the desk told him he should find somewhere else to stay, as the only room they had available was supposedly haunted by the ghost of a man who had died there.
